# 0rbit Package

To improve the DevX while building with 0rbit, we have created an [APM package **"0rbit"**](https://apm.betteridea.dev/pkg?id=LYIFdyKZ0D1B2GBQlPGHnGyawCwQn_sXqBuhqJHKIPs).

This package contains all the CONSTANTS required to interact with 0rbit and provides you with simpe functions to interact with the 0rbit.

## Functions 

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sendGetRequest()` | Make a HTTP GET request to any valid URL. |
| `sendPostRequest()` | Make a HTTP POST request to any valid URL. |
| `receiveResponse()` | Receive the response of the request made. |
| `getBalance()` | Get the balance of **0RBT POINTS** of your processId. |

## Installation

    ```
2. Install the `0rbit` package.

    APM.install("0rbit")
    ```
