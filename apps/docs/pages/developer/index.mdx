# Getting Started

__0rbit__ helps bring the data from any valid URL to your `ao` process. 

Building with __0rbit__ is as simple as making an HTTP GET or POST request to an API; that's all you need to do in `ao`
## Fee

To make a request, you must pay a fee in $0RBT per request. 

This fee is charged for the following reasons:
- To make a sustainable protocol. 
- To prevent spamming of the network.
- Provide incentives to the 0rbit Node Operators.
