# Handlers

In AO handlers are used to interact with the `ao` process.

To interact with 0rbit there are types of handlers:
- `Get-Real-Data`
- `Post-Real-Data`
- `Receive-Response`

## `Get-Real-Data`

`Get-Real-Data` is the GET request Handler in the 0rbit process, which makes the 0rbit nodes make the HTTP GET Request to the provided URL.

<Cards num={1}>
      <Card  title="Learn more about GET Request" href="/developer/get-request/" arrow ="true"/>
</Cards>

## `Post-Real-Data`

`Post-Real-Data` is the POST request Handler in the 0rbit process, which makes the 0rbit nodes make the HTTP POST Request to the provided URL and the data body.

<Cards num={1}>
      <Card  title="Learn more about POST Request" href="/developer/post-request/" arrow ="true"/>
</Cards>

## `Receive-Response`

Since the 0rbit process forwards the data it receives from the 0rbit Nodes, it best to have a defined handler in your process to receive the data.

`Receive-Response` is the Handler name the 0rbit process will call to send the data back to the `ao` process. 

You can create a simple handler in your process and use `msg.Data` to check the data received from the 0rbit process.
