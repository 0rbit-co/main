# POST Request

__0rbit__ enables an `ao` process to __FETCH ANY DATA__ using the data body to make a POST request on the Internet.

This is done by sending the `data body` and the URL to the `0rbit` process, which will make the POST request to the `URL` with the `data body` and send the response back to the `ao` process.

> `0rbit` process returns the data in the format the provided URL returns.

## Post Request Handler
You can pay the fee directly from your process to the `0rbit` process, which requires you to have the $0RBT in your `ao` process before making the request.

On every request, you must pay some fee in $0RBT (currently set to 1 $0RBT).

This method accepts the following tags:
| __Tag__ | __Description__ ||
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `["X-Action"]` | The type of request. | Required |
| `["X-Url"]` | The URL from which you want to fetch the data. | Required |
